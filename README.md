# Potentiometer-Buzzer
If voltage exceeds 3 volts, the buzzer and the built in LED (pin 13) turn ON, and remain ON as long as the voltage remains above the threshold (3 volts). If the voltage drops below 2.5 volts, both the buzzer and LED turn OFF, and remain OFF as long as the voltage is below the threshold (2.5 volts)
